# Concepts of Programming Languages
This is the storage repository for the semester project

## Purpose
    To complete the CS4308 project, a language processor (interpreter) must be developed for 
    a specific subset of the SCL language. The interpreter can be written in any of the following 
    programming languages: C, C++, C#, Java, Python, or Ada.
    
    The language processor should be capable of processing an SCL program, with each token 
    in the language being separated by white spaces. The parsing algorithm must be able to 
    detect any syntactical errors and print an appropriate error message for each error found. In 
    addition, any run-time errors must also be detected, and appropriate error messages should 
    be printed.
    
    To fulfill the requirements of this project, a complete software development process must be 
    applied. This includes ensuring that the source code (of the scanner, parser, and complete 
    interpreter) is well-structured and easy to understand. The code should also include 
    comments to help clarify the implementation.
<br>The project, as a whole, encapsulates the concept of SCL file interpretation, parsing, and translation. The programming language of choice for this endeavour is Python. 

## Structure
Three "Deliverables" will be required before the end of the semester. 

1. SCL Subset Language Interpreter
2. SCL Subset Language Parser
3. SCL Complete Translator
